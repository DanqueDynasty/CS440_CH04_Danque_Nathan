For CS440 test My Justification for using LGPL is

The LGPL License only requires me to open source a portion of my codebase, but not necessarily the entire codebase. As per the license, only segments from other open-source libraries(such as Qt) must be freely available and be executable with the base Libraries. However, custom propietary code(such as rendering algorithms or datastructures) that can exist and execute seperate from the library may remain protected.
